# GenAI
Sample project to demonstrate GenAI usecases.

This way we can have dataset presented to the model and get insights into it by capturing the response either in a database table or output it to the screen. If we have capture the insights into the table it becomes easier to look for trends without having to write another logic. The best part is it can be integrated into an etl pipeline.
